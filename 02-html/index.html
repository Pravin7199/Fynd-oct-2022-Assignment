        Q2. This exercise helps understand the difference between inline, block,
        and inline-block display types. On an HTML page add 3 span elements each
        with the words HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Select the 3 elements using
        the span selector in an embedded style tag on the page and set the width
        to 40%.
      </p>

      <p class="bold">
        * How do the elements appear? Does the width have any effect? Why / Why
        not?
      </p>

      <p>
        The elements appear in inline form. No, the width doesn't have any effect. This is because it is an inline element.
      </p>

      <p class="bold">
        * Next, set display to inline. Does it cause any change? Why / Why not?
      </p>

      <p>
        It does not cause any changes because span is an inline container. This is because we are trying to change inline element to inline itelf.
      </p>

      <p class="bold">
        * Next, change display to block. What change does it cause?
      </p>

      <p>
        This makes the span appear rowwise. This is because it is now a block element. This happens because block takes the whole width of the screen. In block element we can also specify the width and height according to our need.
      </p>

      <p class="bold">
        * Next, set display to inline-block. What change does it cause?
      </p>

      <p>
        It is an inline-block element which means that we can specify the width and height according to our need which is not possible in inline element.
      </p>

      <p class="bold">
        * In conclusion, summarize the differences you noticed in the 3 behavior
        of the 3 display types. Search for other differences and jot them down
        mentally / physically! :)
      </p>

      <p>
        Inline element => In inline element all the elements are placed horizontally side by side. In this type we cannot change the height and width of the element.<br>
        <br>
        Block element => In block element all elements are stacked vertically rowwise. In this type we can change the height and width of the element<br><br>

        Inline-block element => In inline-block all the elements are placed horizontally side by side but here we can specify the height and width of the element.
